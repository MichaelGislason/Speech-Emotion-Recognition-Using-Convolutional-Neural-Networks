Speech Emotion Recognition Using Various CNN Architectures
Please see the uploaded pdf for a detailed report on what I learned from a semester-long deep dive into the application of neural networks and deep learning for the purpose of speech emotion recognition (SER), specifically in the context of personal robots. I discuss related work, data and data pre-processing, various model architectures, my experimental results, the effects of data augmentation and some recommendations for avenues of future research.
